## Overview
CAT Bridge (Compounds And Transcripts Bridge) CAT Bridge is a comprehensive multi-omics integration and analysis tool, It stands out in its ability to identify gene-metabolite pairs with biological association by fusing transcriptomic and metabolomic data. This is accomplished through the combined use of causality modeling and artificial intelligence.
